## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Android Studio** (latest version)
- **JDK 8 or later**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **A device/emulator** with Android 5.0 or later.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
  - Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing project."
  - Navigate to the project directory you just cloned and select it.

3. **Set up the Unsplash API key**:
  - Sign up for an Unsplash account and generate an API key.
  - Add the API key to your project as a secret or an environment variable.
  - Alternatively, add your API key to the `gradle.properties` file:
      ```plaintext
      UNSPLASH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
      ```

4. **Build and Run the Application**:
  - In Android Studio, build the project by clicking the Build menu and selecting "Build Project."
  - Once the build is complete, run the app on a connected device or emulator.

## Usage

- When the application starts, it will fetch images from the Unsplash API and display them in a scrollable grid.
- Use swipe gestures to scroll through the grid of images.
- Images are loaded asynchronously and efficiently for optimal performance.

## Caching Mechanism

- The application uses an in-memory and/or disk cache to store images retrieved from the API.
- This caching mechanism helps improve performance and reduce network usage.

## Error Handling

- Network errors and image loading failures are handled gracefully.
- Informative error messages or placeholders are displayed when there is an issue fetching or loading images.

## API Keys

- Make sure to keep your API keys secure and do not expose them in source control or public repositories.

## Troubleshooting

- **App Crashes**: Ensure you are using the latest version of Android Studio and all dependencies are up-to-date.
- **Network Errors**: Check your network connection and ensure the Unsplash API key is valid.
- **Image Loading Issues**: Check the logs for any specific error messages related to image loading.
